# Initial Network State

**Our initial goal is not to find a stable price.** This may seem antithetical to our currency aspirations, but we ensure you it is not. Olympus can be tuned to optimize for different things. The main tradeoff is volatility and profitability versus stability and consistency. With volatility and profit comes growth; this is what we want early on.

With tight policy and scale, Olympus should function well as a stable asset. Upward and downward pressures should stabilize at some non-intrinsic value. With loose policy, regardless of scale, Olympus has the potential to act as a wealth creation machine. The market premium of the token measures the positive sum of the game; all extrinsic value is new wealth created.

**Alpha State**

The initial network features a one-way treasury \(money goes in, none comes out\), the bonding contract \(through which supply increases and profits are produced\), and the staking contract \(where profits are distributed\). 

**The initial policy state is:**

* **Bonding Control Variable = 30**
* **Bond Vesting Term = 20 epochs \(~6.3 days\)**
* **90% profit to stakers, 10% profit to the DAO**
