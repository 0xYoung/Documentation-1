# Policy

Olympus features policy constants that allow us to optimize the system. 

## Bonds

The **BCV** allows us to scale the rate at which bond premiums increase. A higher BCV means a lower discount for bonders and less inflation. A lower BCV means a higher capacity for bonders and less protocol profit.

The **vesting term** determines how long it takes for bonds to become redeemable. A longer term means lower inflation and lower bond demand. 

## Sales

The **ICV** allows us to scale protocol sell pressure up or down. A higher ICV means more sell pressure and higher inflation. A lower ICV means less sell pressure and lower profitability.

The **DCV** allows us to scale protocol buy pressure up or down. A higher DCV means more buy pressure and higher deflation. A lower DCV means less buy pressure and a weaker floor.

The **discount rate** determines the arbitrage available to execute protocol market orders. A higher discount means greater incentive to fill the protocol's order but lower profitability.

## Treasury

Profit Allocations are the only treasury variable. This allows us to choose who receives profits from the protocol.

## Staking

There are no variables in the staking contract. OHM and sOHM are always redeemable 1:1, and profits are always distributed equally through rebase.
